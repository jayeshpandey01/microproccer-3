To run an assembly program like the one provided in Ubuntu, you'll need to assemble and link it using a suitable assembler and linker. Then you can execute the resulting binary. Here are the steps:

1. **Save your assembly code**: Save the assembly code provided in a file, for example, `multiply.asm`.

2. **Install NASM**: If you haven't already installed NASM, you can do so using the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nasm
   ```

3. **Assemble the code**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where your assembly code is saved, and assemble it using NASM:
   ```
   nasm -f elf32 -o multiply.o multiply.asm
   ```

4. **Link the object file**: Link the object file produced by NASM using a linker (in this case, the GNU linker, `ld`):
   ```
   ld -m elf_i386 -o multiply multiply.o
   ```

5. **Run the program**: Now you can run the executable:
   ```
   ./multiply
   ```

6. **Input two numbers**: Follow the prompts to input two numbers, and the program will multiply them using the successive addition method and display the result.

This should execute the program and perform the multiplication as described in the assembly code. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the file and that you're running the commands from the correct directory where your assembly code is located.
